Oscillator systems achieve synchronization when oscillators are coupled. The presomitic mesoderm is a system of cellular oscillators, where coordinated genetic activity is necessary for proper periodic generation of somites. While Notch signaling is required for the synchronization of these cells it is unclear what information the cells exchange and how they react to this information to align their oscillatory pace with that of their neighbors.

In a recent collaboration with the [Charisios Lab](https://www.fmi.ch/research-groups/groupleader.html?group=137) at the FMI, we combined mathematical modeling and experimental data to show that interaction between murine presomitic mesoderm cells is controlled by a phase-gated and unidirectional coupling mechanism and results in deceleration of their oscillation pace upon Notch signaling.

This mechanism predicts that isolated populations of well mixed cells synchronize, revealing a stereotypical synchronization in the mouse PSM and contradicting expectations from previously applied theoretical approaches. Collectively, our theoretical and experimental findings reveal the underlying coupling mechanisms of the presomitic mesoderm cells and provide a framework to quantitatively characterize their synchronization.
