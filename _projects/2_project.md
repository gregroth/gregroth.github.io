In the cell, messenger RNAs — or mRNAs — are translated into proteins and eventually degraded, but the relationship between translation and mRNA decay remains cloudy. 

In a recent collaboration with the Chao lab at FMI, we showed that translation of an mRNA reduced its stability. Mathematical models confirmed the experimental results, suggesting that the degradation rates of mRNAs increase each time the molecules are translated into proteins.
