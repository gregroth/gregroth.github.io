Transcriptional control in mammals critically depends on enhancers, which control tissue specificity and
developmental timing of many genes. Enhancers are often located hundreds of kilobases away from target promoters and are thought to control gene expression by interacting with them in the three-dimensional space of the nucleus. However what type of interactions lead to, and how chromosome interactions are actually translated into, transcriptional outputs remains unclear. 

In a recent collaboration with the [Giorgetti Lab](https://giorgettilab.org/) at FMI, we proposed a mechanism in which stochastic enhancer-promoter interactions are transmitted into slower promoter ON/OFF dynamics through small numbers of intermediate regulatory processes.
