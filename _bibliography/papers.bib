 abstract = {A successful method to describe the asymptotic behavior of a discrete time stochastic process governed by some recursive formula is to relate it to the limit sets of a well-chosen mean differential equation. Under an attainability condition, Benaïm proved that convergence to a given attractor of the flow induced by this dynamical system occurs with positive probability for a class of Robbins Monro algorithms. Benaïm, Hofbauer, and Sorin generalised this approach for stochastic approximation algorithms whose average behavior is related to a differential inclusion instead. We pursue the analogy by extending to this setting the result of convergence with positive probability to an attractor.},

@article{Zuin:2022aa,
	abstract = {Chromosome structure in mammals is thought to regulate transcription by modulating three-dimensional interactions between enhancers and promoters, notably through CTCF-mediated loops and topologically associating domains (TADs)1--4. However, how chromosome interactions are actually translated into transcriptional outputs remains unclear. Here, to address this question, we use an assay to position an enhancer at large numbers of densely spaced chromosomal locations relative to a fixed promoter, and measure promoter output and interactions within a genomic region with minimal regulatory and structural complexity. A quantitative analysis of hundreds of cell lines reveals that the transcriptional effect of an enhancer depends on its contact probabilities with the promoter through a nonlinear relationship. Mathematical modelling suggests that nonlinearity might arise from transient enhancer--promoter interactions being translated into slower promoter bursting dynamics in individual cells, therefore uncoupling the temporal dynamics of interactions from those of transcription. This uncovers a potential mechanism of how distal enhancers act from large genomic distances, and of how topologically associating domain boundaries block distal enhancers. Finally, we show that enhancer strength also determines absolute transcription levels as well as the sensitivity of a promoter to CTCF-mediated transcriptional insulation. Our measurements establish general principles for the context-dependent role of chromosome structure in long-range transcriptional regulation.},

@article{DAVE2023589,
	abstract = {Summary
The relationship between mRNA translation and decay is incompletely understood, with conflicting reports suggesting that translation can either promote decay or stabilize mRNAs. The effect of translation on mRNA decay has mainly been studied using ensemble measurements and global transcription and translation inhibitors, which can have pleiotropic effects. We developed a single-molecule imaging approach to control the translation of a specific transcript that enabled simultaneous measurement of translation and mRNA decay. Our results demonstrate that mRNA translation reduces mRNA stability, and mathematical modeling suggests that this process is dependent on ribosome flux. Furthermore, our results indicate that miRNAs mediate efficient degradation of both translating and non-translating target mRNAs and reveal a predominant role for mRNA degradation in miRNA-mediated regulation. Simultaneous observation of translation and decay of single mRNAs provides a framework to directly study how these processes are interconnected in cells.},

	abstract = {Abstract Adaptive radiations are known for rapid niche diversification in response to ecological opportunity. While most resources usually exist prior to adaptive radiation, novel niches associated with novel resources can be created as a clade diversifies. For example, in African lake cichlid radiations some species prey upon other species of the clade (intraclade consumers). Using a trait-based eco-evolutionary model, we investigate the evolution of intraclade consumers in adaptive radiations and the effect of this novel trophic interaction on the diversification process of the radiating clade. We find that the evolutionary emergence of intraclade consumers halts the diversification processes of other ecomorphs as a result of increased top-down control of density. Because high productivity enables earlier evolution of intraclade consumers, highly productive environments come to harbour less species-rich radiations than comparable radiations in less productive environments. Our results reveal how macroevolutionary and community patterns can emerge from ecological and microevolutionary processes.},
