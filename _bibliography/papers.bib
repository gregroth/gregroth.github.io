 abstract = {A successful method to describe the asymptotic behavior of a discrete time stochastic process governed by some recursive formula is to relate it to the limit sets of a well-chosen mean differential equation. Under an attainability condition, Benaïm proved that convergence to a given attractor of the flow induced by this dynamical system occurs with positive probability for a class of Robbins Monro algorithms. Benaïm, Hofbauer, and Sorin generalised this approach for stochastic approximation algorithms whose average behavior is related to a differential inclusion instead. We pursue the analogy by extending to this setting the result of convergence with positive probability to an attractor.},

	abstract = {Individuals within any species exhibit differences in size, developmental state, or spatial location. These differences coupled with environmental fluctuations in demographic rates can have subtle effects on population persistence and species coexistence. To understand these effects, we provide a general theory for coexistence of structured, interacting species living in a stochastic environment. The theory is applicable to nonlinear, multi species matrix models with stochastically varying parameters. The theory relies on long-term growth rates of species corresponding to the dominant Lyapunov exponents of random matrix products. Our coexistence criterion requires that a convex combination of these long-term growth rates is positive with probability one whenever one or more species are at low density. When this condition holds, the community is stochastically persistent: the fraction of time that a species density goes below {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}delta >0{\$}{\$}approaches zero as {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}delta {\$}{\$}approaches zero. Applications to predator-prey interactions in an autocorrelated environment, a stochastic LPA model, and spatial lottery models are provided. These applications demonstrate that positive autocorrelations in temporal fluctuations can disrupt predator-prey coexistence, fluctuations in log-fecundity can facilitate persistence in structured populations, and long-lived, relatively sedentary competing populations are likely to coexist in spatially and temporally heterogenous environments.},

@article{rothCaswell16,
	abstract = {Summary Demographic models describe population dynamics in terms of the movement of individuals among states (e.g. size, age, developmental stage, parity, frailty, physiological condition). Matrix population models originally classified individuals by a single characteristic. This was enlarged to two characteristics in vec-permutation models and the closely related megamatrix models. However, it has been recognised that the interplay of more than two characteristics can affect the population dynamics. Here, we present a framework, called hyperstate matrix model, in which individuals may be classified by any number of characteristics, using the generalisation of the vec-permutation approach to hypermatrices. These models are constructed from a simple block-diagonal matrix formulation of the movement of individuals among each dimension of the i-state. This framework provides a step-by-step construction and makes available the usual demographic analysis developed for classical matrix models. In particular, we derive a general formula for the sensitivity of any output of the hyperstate matrix model, to any vector of parameters. In spite of the technicalities underlying these models, implementation is straightforward and we provide the MATLAB code to carry it out. We apply this approach to a three-dimensional example in which individuals are classified by developmental stage, age and heterogeneity classes. The analysis of this model provides insights into how the heritability of the heterogeneity classes affects the long-term growth rate of the population. As the questions in conservation biology become more sophisticated and data on threatened species become more detailed, multiple dimensions in demographic models will become increasingly important. Hyperstate matrix methods will make such analyses possible and directly applicable to conservation and population management.},

@article{rothcaswell18,
	abstract = {As an individual moves through its life cycle, it passes through a series of states (age classes, size classes, reproductive states, spatial locations, health statuses, etc.) before its eventual death. The occupancy time in a state is the time spent in that state over the individual's life. Depending on the life cycle description, the occupancy times describe different demographic variables, for example, lifetime breeding success, lifetime habitat utilisation, or healthy longevity. Models based on absorbing Markov chains provide a powerful framework for the analysis of occupancy times. Current theory, however, can completely analyse only the occupancy of single states, although the occupancy time in a set of states is often desired. For example, a range of sizes in a size-classified model, an age class in an age×stage model, and a group of locations in a spatial stage model are all sets of states. We present a new mathematical approach to absorbing Markov chains that extends the analysis of life histories by providing a comprehensive theory for the occupancy of arbitrary sets of states, and for other demographic variables related to these sets (e.g., reaching time, return time). We apply this approach to a matrix population model of the Southern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides). The analysis of this model provides interesting insight into the lifetime number of breeding attempts of this species. Our new approach to absorbing Markov chains, and its implementation in matrix oriented software, makes the analysis of occupancy times more accessible to population ecologists, and directly applicable to any matrix population models.},

@article{caswelletal18,
	abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a comprehensive theory for the demographic analysis of populations in which individuals are classified by both age and stage. The earliest demographic models were age classified. Ecologists adopted methods developed by human demographers and used life tables to quantify survivorship and fertility of cohorts and the growth rates and structures of populations. Later, motivated by studies of plants and insects, matrix population models structured by size or stage were developed. The theory of these models has been extended to cover all the aspects of age-classified demography and more. It is a natural development to consider populations classified by both age and stage. A steady trickle of results has appeared since the 1960s, analyzing one or another aspect of age × stage-classified populations, in both ecology and human demography. Here, we use the vec-permutation formulation of multistate matrix population models to incorporate age- and stage-specific vital rates into demographic analysis. We present cohort results for the life table functions (survivorship, mortality, and fertility), the dynamics of intra-cohort selection, the statistics of longevity, the joint distribution of age and stage at death, and the statistics of life disparity. Combining transitions and fertility yields a complete set of population dynamic results, including population growth rates and structures, net reproductive rate, the statistics of lifetime reproduction, and measures of generation time. We present a complete analysis of a hypothetical model species, inspired by poecilogonous marine invertebrates that produce two kinds of larval offspring. Given the joint effects of age and stage, many familiar demographic results become multidimensional, so calculations of marginal and mixture distributions are an important tool. From an age-classified point of view, stage structure is a form of unobserved heterogeneity. From a stage-classified point of view, age structure is unobserved heterogeneity. In an age × stage-classified model, variance in demographic outcomes can be partitioned into contributions from both sources. Because these models are formulated as matrices, they are amenable to a complete sensitivity analysis. As more detailed and longer longitudinal studies are developed, age × stage-classified demography will become more common and more important.},

@article{deereetal21,
	abstract = {Abstract Dispersal is an important form of movement influencing population dynamics, species distribution and gene flow between populations. In population models, dispersal is often included in a simplified manner by removing a random proportion of the population. Many ecologists now argue that models should be formulated at the level of individuals instead of the population level. To fully understand the effects of dispersal on natural systems, it is therefore necessary to incorporate individual-level differences in dispersal behavior in population models. Here, we parameterized an integral projection model, which allows for studying how individual life histories determine population-level processes, using bulb mites, Rhizoglyphus robini, to assess to what extent dispersal expression (frequency of individuals in the dispersal stage) and dispersal probability affect the proportion of successful dispersers and natal population growth rate. We find that allowing for life-history differences between resident phenotypes and disperser phenotypes shows that multiple combinations of dispersal probability and dispersal expression can produce the same proportion of leaving individuals. Additionally, a given proportion of successful dispersing individuals result in different natal population growth rates. The results highlight that dispersal life histories, and the frequency with which disperser phenotypes occur in the natal population, significantly affect population-level processes. Thus, biological realism of dispersal population models can be increased by incorporating the typically observed life-history differences between resident phenotypes and disperser phenotypes, and we here present a methodology to do so.},

Biological phase transitions form membrane-less organelles that generate distinct cellular environments. How molecules are partitioned between these compartments and the surrounding cellular space and the functional consequence of this localization is not well understood. Here, we report the localization of mRNA to stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs) and its effect on translation and degradation during the integrated stress response. Using single mRNA imaging in living human cells, we find that the interactions of mRNAs with SGs and PBs have different dynamics, very few mRNAs directly move between SGs and PBs, and that specific RNA-binding proteins can anchor mRNAs within these compartments. During recovery from stress, we show that mRNAs that were within SGs and PBs are translated and degraded at similar rates as their cytosolic counterparts. Our work provides a framework for using single-molecule measurements to directly investigate the molecular mechanisms of phase-separated compartments within their cellular environment.},

@article{MATEJU20201801,
	abstract = {Summary
Cellular stress leads to reprogramming of mRNA translation and formation of stress granules (SGs), membraneless organelles consisting of mRNA and RNA-binding proteins. Although the function of SGs remains largely unknown, it is widely assumed they contain exclusively non-translating mRNA. Here, we re-examine this hypothesis using single-molecule imaging of mRNA translation in living cells. Although we observe non-translating mRNAs are preferentially recruited to SGs, we find unequivocal evidence that mRNAs localized to SGs can undergo translation. Our data indicate that SG-associated translation is not rare, and the entire translation cycle (initiation, elongation, and termination) can occur on SG-localized transcripts. Furthermore, translating mRNAs can be observed transitioning between the cytosol and SGs without changing their translational status. Together, these results demonstrate that mRNA localization to SGs is compatible with translation and argue against a direct role for SGs in inhibition of protein synthesis.},

We find that the accumulation of double-strand breaks (DSB) is not due to altered DSB repair, but by the uncoordinated activity of base excision repair (BER) at Zeocin-modified DNA bases. We inhibit DSB formation by eliminating glycosylases and/or the endonucleases Apn1/2 and Rad1, implicating these conserved BER enzymes, or events downstream of them, in the conversion of base damage into DSBs. Among DNA polymerases, the reduction of Pol δ, and to a lesser extent Pol ε and Trf4 (a Pol β-like polymerase), reduces DSB formation. Finally, the BER enzymes, Ogg1 and AP endonuclease, are shown to co-precipitate with actin from yeast extracts and as purified proteins, suggesting that actin may interfere directly with the repair of Zeocin-induced damage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Multiple natural and artificial oscillator systems achieve synchronisation when oscillators are coupled. The coupling mechanism, essentially the communication between oscillators, is often assumed to be continuous and bidirectional. However, the cells of the presomitic mesoderm synchronise their gene expression oscillations through Notch signalling, which is intermittent and directed from a ligand-presenting to a receptor-presenting cell. Motivated by this mode of communication we present a phase-gated and unidirectional coupling mechanism. We identify conditions under which it can successfully bring two or more oscillators to cycle in-phase. In the presomitic mesoderm we observed the oscillatory dynamics of two synchronizing cell populations and record one population halting its pace while the other keeps undisturbed, as would be predicted from our model. For the same system another important prediction, convergence to a specific range of phases upon synchronisation is also confirmed. Thus, the proposed mechanism accurately describes the coordinated oscillations of the presomitic mesoderm cells and provides an alternative framework for deciphering synchronisation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {In mammals, interactions between sequences within topologically associating domains enable control of gene expression across large genomic distances. Yet it is unknown how frequently such contacts occur, how long they last and how they depend on the dynamics of chromosome folding and loop extrusion activity of cohesin. By imaging chromosomal locations at high spatial and temporal resolution in living cells, we show that interactions within topologically associating domains are transient and occur frequently during the course of a cell cycle. Interactions become more frequent and longer in the presence of convergent CTCF sites, resulting in suppression of variability in chromosome folding across time. Supported by physical models of chromosome dynamics, our data suggest that CTCF-anchored loops last around 10 min. Our results show that long-range transcriptional regulation might rely on transient physical proximity, and that cohesin and CTCF stabilize highly dynamic chromosome structures, facilitating selected subsets of chromosomal interactions.},

@article{Zuin:2022aa,
	abstract = {Chromosome structure in mammals is thought to regulate transcription by modulating three-dimensional interactions between enhancers and promoters, notably through CTCF-mediated loops and topologically associating domains (TADs)1--4. However, how chromosome interactions are actually translated into transcriptional outputs remains unclear. Here, to address this question, we use an assay to position an enhancer at large numbers of densely spaced chromosomal locations relative to a fixed promoter, and measure promoter output and interactions within a genomic region with minimal regulatory and structural complexity. A quantitative analysis of hundreds of cell lines reveals that the transcriptional effect of an enhancer depends on its contact probabilities with the promoter through a nonlinear relationship. Mathematical modelling suggests that nonlinearity might arise from transient enhancer--promoter interactions being translated into slower promoter bursting dynamics in individual cells, therefore uncoupling the temporal dynamics of interactions from those of transcription. This uncovers a potential mechanism of how distal enhancers act from large genomic distances, and of how topologically associating domain boundaries block distal enhancers. Finally, we show that enhancer strength also determines absolute transcription levels as well as the sensitivity of a promoter to CTCF-mediated transcriptional insulation. Our measurements establish general principles for the context-dependent role of chromosome structure in long-range transcriptional regulation.},

	abstract = {Summary
The relationship between mRNA translation and decay is incompletely understood, with conflicting reports suggesting that translation can either promote decay or stabilize mRNAs. The effect of translation on mRNA decay has mainly been studied using ensemble measurements and global transcription and translation inhibitors, which can have pleiotropic effects. We developed a single-molecule imaging approach to control the translation of a specific transcript that enabled simultaneous measurement of translation and mRNA decay. Our results demonstrate that mRNA translation reduces mRNA stability, and mathematical modeling suggests that this process is dependent on ribosome flux. Furthermore, our results indicate that miRNAs mediate efficient degradation of both translating and non-translating target mRNAs and reveal a predominant role for mRNA degradation in miRNA-mediated regulation. Simultaneous observation of translation and decay of single mRNAs provides a framework to directly study how these processes are interconnected in cells.},

	abstract = {Abstract Adaptive radiations are known for rapid niche diversification in response to ecological opportunity. While most resources usually exist prior to adaptive radiation, novel niches associated with novel resources can be created as a clade diversifies. For example, in African lake cichlid radiations some species prey upon other species of the clade (intraclade consumers). Using a trait-based eco-evolutionary model, we investigate the evolution of intraclade consumers in adaptive radiations and the effect of this novel trophic interaction on the diversification process of the radiating clade. We find that the evolutionary emergence of intraclade consumers halts the diversification processes of other ecomorphs as a result of increased top-down control of density. Because high productivity enables earlier evolution of intraclade consumers, highly productive environments come to harbour less species-rich radiations than comparable radiations in less productive environments. Our results reveal how macroevolutionary and community patterns can emerge from ecological and microevolutionary processes.},
