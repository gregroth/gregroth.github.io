Welcome to my page! I am a mathematician with a strong interest in biology. My research interests focus on developping mathematical models, and uncovering their emergent properties using analytical methods and numerical simulations.

I am currently working at the [Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research](https://www.fmi.ch) in Basel, where I collaborate with scientists to model biological processes with a focus on Genome Regulation and Multicellular Systems.
