- **Brief Introduction to Mathematical Modelling.** This course provides a brief introduction to mathematical modelling in molecular biology. Emphasis is placed on what is a mathematical model and how can it be used in your research. 

- **How can we use mathemtaical models to infer bursting kinetics the distribution of # mRNA per cell?** This course provides an introduction to the two-state model for transcriptional bursting and a tutorial on how such model can be fitted to distributions of mRNA per cell obtained from Single Molecule Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (smFISH) experiments. We then discuss how to interpret the fitted model in terms of transcriptional burst dynamics.

- **Stochastic models for transcriptional bursting.** This course introduces students to mathematical modeling of gene expression with a focus on the processes invloved in transcription. Emphasis is placed on the mathematical concepts underlying the model description and its analysis. We also discuss how those concepts are related to experimental results.
